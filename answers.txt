1.  Pros and cons of Agile dev: 
        Pros: iterative approach, breaks down projects to several (more managable) stages
        Cons: flexibility can lead to a massive project scope, documentation isn't always consistent between devs

2.  Scrum Master vs Project Owner:
        Scrum Master: all scrum related tasks, including Jira tooling, facilitating sprints, meetings, etc.
        Project Owner: sets direction for the team, handles releases and stakeholder management.

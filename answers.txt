1.  Pros and cons of Agile dev: 
        Pros: iterative approach, breaks down projects to several (more managable) stages
        Cons: flexibility can lead to a massive project scope, documentation isn't always consistent between devs

2.  Scrum Master vs Project Owner:
        Scrum Master: all scrum related tasks, including Jira tooling, facilitating sprints, meetings, etc.
        Project Owner: sets direction for the team, handles releases and stakeholder management.

3.  3 types of meetings:
        sprint planning meeting: determine what to complete in the sprint, start sprint
        daily scrum/standup meeting: discuss work completed, discuss work plan for the day and any blockers
        sprint retrospective meeting: close sprint, discuss work complete and move incomplete to backlog.

4.  epic vs story vs bug vs issue:
        epic: large body of work that can be broken down into stories
        story: software system requirement that can be expressed in a couple of sentences
        task issue: a unit of work that can be tracked through a workflow
        bug: something blocking or affecting the completion of an action item
